    # Connect differential pair reference to power
    xlr_male.audio.p.reference ~ power_3v3

    xlr_male.ground ~ power_3v3.lv

    # --- Example 2: Female XLR connector ---
    xlr_female = new XLR_Female_PC_Mount
    
    # Connect differential pair reference to power
    xlr_female.audio.p.reference ~ power_3v3
    xlr_female.audio.n.reference ~ power_3v3
    
    # Connect ground to power ground

    # --- Example connection: XLR cable simulation ---
    # Connect male to female to simulate an XLR cable
    xlr_male.audio ~ xlr_female.audio
    xlr_male.ground ~ xlr_female.ground

    # --- Example connections to external circuits ---
    # For audio input/output, you can connect to:
    # audio_codec.balanced_input ~ xlr_female.audio
    # audio_amplifier.balanced_output ~ xlr_male.audio
